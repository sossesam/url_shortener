For a user management system in Flask, you'll typically need to implement several API endpoints to handle user registration, authentication, and other user-related operations. Here’s a list of common endpoints you would need, along with their HTTP methods and purposes:

### 1. **User Registration**
- **Endpoint**: `/register`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Purpose**: To allow a new user to create an account by submitting their details (e.g., email, password, name).

### 2. **User Login**
- **Endpoint**: `/login`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Purpose**: To authenticate a user by checking their credentials (usually email and password) and issue a session token or JWT.

### 3. **User Logout**
- **Endpoint**: `/logout`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Purpose**: To log the user out and invalidate their session or JWT token.

### 4. **Get User Profile**
- **Endpoint**: `/user`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Purpose**: To fetch the details of the currently authenticated user (e.g., name, email, etc.).

### 5. **Update User Profile**
- **Endpoint**: `/user`
- **Method**: `PUT`
- **Purpose**: To allow the authenticated user to update their profile information (e.g., name, email, password).

### 6. **Delete User Account**
- **Endpoint**: `/user`
- **Method**: `DELETE`
- **Purpose**: To delete the user’s account from the system.

### 7. **Forgot Password**
- **Endpoint**: `/forgot-password`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Purpose**: To allow a user to request a password reset link. The system would send an email with a reset link.

### 8. **Reset Password**
- **Endpoint**: `/reset-password`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Purpose**: To allow a user to reset their password using a token received via email.

### 9. **User List (Admin only)**
- **Endpoint**: `/users`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Purpose**: (Admin only) To get a list of all registered users.

### 10. **Delete User (Admin only)**
- **Endpoint**: `/users/<user_id>`
- **Method**: `DELETE`
- **Purpose**: (Admin only) To delete a user by their ID.

### 11. **Update User (Admin only)**
- **Endpoint**: `/users/<user_id>`
- **Method**: `PUT`
- **Purpose**: (Admin only) To update a user's information (e.g., role, active status).

### Optional Endpoints:
- **Verify Email**: `/verify-email`
  - Used for email verification upon registration.
- **Change Password**: `/change-password`
  - Allows users to change their password while logged in.

### Common Flask Tools for Implementation:
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** for handling database models.
- **Flask-JWT-Extended** or **Flask-Login** for authentication (JWT tokens or session management).
- **Flask-Mail** for sending emails (e.g., for password reset).
- **Flask-WTF** for form validation.
